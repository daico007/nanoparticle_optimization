This tutorial provides an example of how to perform an optimization between two
coarse-grained nanoparticles.  Nanoparticles are generated as a spherical shell
of coarse-grained beads.  We are optimizing the interaction between the beads,
matching the nanoparticle-nanoparticle interaction potential to a set of target
data.
