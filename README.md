# NanoOpt: Deriving potentials for coarse-grained nanoparticles via potential-matching

# Installation

NanoOpt is centered around the [mBuild package](https://github.com/mosdef-hub/mbuild) which is easiest to install using the Anaconda package manager. The recommended installation instructions are as follows:

Install mBuild using conda:
```
conda install -c omnia -c mosdef mbuild
```

NanoOpt can then be cloned and installed via:
```
git clone https://github.com/summeraz/nanoparticle_optimization
cd nanoparticle_optimization
pip install .
```

# Tutorials

The `tutorials` directory contains several tutorials in the form of Jupyter notebooks
that walk through the basics of the optimization code.
